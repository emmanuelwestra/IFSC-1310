                                <strong>2001-2004: Founding</strong>
                                <p>Elon Musk's journey to founding SpaceX began in early 2001 when he met with Mars Society's Robert Zubrin, donated $100,000 to the organization, and briefly joined its board. During a Mars Society convention, Musk proposed Mars Oasis, a project aimed at growing plants on Mars using a landed greenhouse. Initially, Musk sought to purchase a Dnepr ICBM from Russia for this project but faced obstacles as Russian contacts were increasingly unreceptive.</p>
                                <p>After a fruitless trip to Moscow with Michael Griffin, Musk decided on the return flight to start his own company to build affordable rockets, believing that vertical integration, the use of cost-effective commercial components, and software engineering principles could reduce launch costs significantly. Griffin, who was involved in these early discussions, would later become a key figure in NASA and the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program.</p>
                                <p>In 2002, Musk began assembling a team for his new venture, soon to be named SpaceX. He recruited key figures including Michael Griffin, Jim Cantrell, John Garvey, Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson, selecting a warehouse in El Segundo, California, as SpaceX's first headquarters. Key hires like Gwynne Shotwell and others from nearby aerospace firms joined the team, contributing to the company’s development. By November 2005, SpaceX had grown to 160 employees. Musk's overarching goal with SpaceX was to reduce the cost of space access by tenfold, enhancing the reliability of space travel.</p>

                                <strong>2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches</strong>
                                <p>SpaceX developed and launched its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with the entire project funded internally at a cost of $90 to $100 million. The Falcon 1, named after the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars, faced significant early challenges. The first three attempts to launch Falcon 1 between 2006 and 2008 failed, placing SpaceX on the brink of bankruptcy, a crisis exacerbated by concurrent financial troubles at Tesla Motors.</p>
                                <p>The tide turned for SpaceX with the successful fourth launch of Falcon 1 in September 2008. This victory, combined with a critical NASA contract worth $1.6 billion awarded in December, stabilized the company financially. Following its second successful launch in July 2009, Falcon 1 was retired to focus efforts on developing the larger Falcon 9 rocket. This period also saw Gwynne Shotwell's promotion to company president, recognizing her role in negotiating the pivotal NASA contract.</p>

                                <strong>2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contract</strong>
                                <p>SpaceX shifted its focus from the planned intermediate-capacity Falcon 5 to developing the Falcon 9, a heavier and reusable launch vehicle, supported significantly by NASA's financial commitment through the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The Falcon 9's development was part of a larger $278 million contract with NASA, which also included funding for the Dragon spacecraft and its demonstration missions. The first successful Falcon 9 launch occurred in June 2010 with a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft, marking a pivotal moment in SpaceX's trajectory.</p>
                                <p>Following this, the operational phase began with the Dragon spacecraft's first mission in December 2010, which successfully completed its objectives after two orbits. By 2011, SpaceX was producing a Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months. The following year, NASA further supported SpaceX's ambitions by contracting the company to develop an integrated launch escape system for the Dragon spacecraft, aiming to human-rate it for crew transport to the International Space Station (ISS). This period culminated in a significant milestone in May 2012, when Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the ISS, effectively doubling SpaceX's private equity valuation to $2.4 billion and setting the stage for its future reusability tests.</p>

                                <strong>2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth</strong>
                                <p>SpaceX experienced significant growth and milestones, marking its entry into the commercial launch market. In 2013, the company successfully completed its first commercial mission for a private customer. By 2014, SpaceX had become a formidable competitor in the global space launch industry, securing nine out of twenty competitively bid contracts. This period also saw SpaceX challenging the long-standing dominance of United Launch Alliance (ULA) in launching U.S. military payloads, leading to a market shift due to SpaceX's more competitive pricing. In September 2014, SpaceX was awarded the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract by NASA, which aimed to finalize the development of a Crew Transportation System including tests and operational missions.</p>
                                <p>Financially, 2015 was notable for SpaceX as it secured $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, which valued the company at around $12 billion. During the same period, SpaceX announced the development of the Starlink project, planning to deploy 4,000 satellites to provide global broadband internet services. However, the year also witnessed a major setback when the Falcon 9 rocket failed during the CRS-7 resupply mission to the ISS in June, due to a structural failure involving a steel strut in the assembly, highlighting the technical challenges associated with space missions.</p>

                                <strong>2015–2017: Reusability milestones</strong>
                                <p>SpaceX marked significant progress in rocket reusability, a cornerstone of its strategy to reduce space travel costs. In December 2015, SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 rocket's first stage for the first time. Building on this success, in April 2016, the company achieved its first landing on the autonomous drone ship "Of Course I Still Love You" in the Atlantic Ocean. By October 2016, the reliability of these landings led SpaceX to offer a 10% discount to customers willing to launch their payloads using reused Falcon 9 first stages.</p>
                                <p>However, 2016 also brought challenges; a major setback occurred in September when a Falcon 9 exploded during a pre-launch test due to a failure involving solidified liquid oxygen, destroying the AMOS-6 satellite valued at $200 million. This incident prompted a four-month pause in launches as SpaceX investigated the failure. The company resumed flights in January 2017 and achieved another milestone in March 2017 by successfully re-launching and recovering a used Falcon 9 first stage for the SES-10 mission. This marked the first re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket, reinforcing SpaceX's commitment to and progress in rocket reusability.</p>

                                <strong>2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider</strong>
                                <p>In 2017 and 2018, SpaceX solidified its position as the leading global commercial launch provider. By mid-2017, the company raised $350 million, boosting its valuation to $21 billion. Over the course of 2017, SpaceX captured 45% of the global market share for commercial launch contracts, reflecting its growing dominance in the sector. By March 2018, SpaceX had over 100 scheduled launches worth approximately $12 billion in revenue, with a diverse client base including both commercial entities and government agencies such as NASA and the Department of Defense.</p>
                                <p>During this period, SpaceX also expanded its business ventures by forming a subsidiary, The Boring Company, in 2017. Initially using a small number of SpaceX employees, The Boring Company focused on constructing a test tunnel near SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. This tunnel project was completed in May 2018 and opened to the public by the end of 2018. Following its establishment, The Boring Company was spun off into a separate entity, with SpaceX retaining 6% equity, less than 10% allocated to early employees, and the majority going to Elon Musk. This expansion highlighted SpaceX’s influence and innovation extending beyond aerospace into infrastructure and transportation solutions.</p>
