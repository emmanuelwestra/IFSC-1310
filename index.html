              <h6 class="square-item">Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h6>
              <p>For this assignment I designed a website for the ficticious client SpaceX based on specifications provided by professor Dr. Wallace. The task was to build a three page promotional web site for the SpaceX Dragon Vehicle. The webpages I created included `Home`, `History`, `FAQ`, and `Contact`. First, I will look at my development process for the SpaceX Dragon website. This is focused on my first version of the website (V1, i.e., draft). Then in the final paragraph I will look at the changes I made for version 2 (V2, i.e., final design).</p>
              <p>The first step was reviewing the specifications for the project and synthezing an overall project plan. Before doing wireframing I decided to review relevant websites in the aerospace industry for inspiration. For instance, I looked at <i>SpaceX.com</i>, <i>blueorigin.com</i>, and <i>NASA.gov</i>. I also used <i>awwwards.org</i> for great graphic design inspiration.</p>
              <p>With the basic completed I created the wireframe for my project. I chose to to do by hand as the project is simple. For larger projects I will use Figma. Then I used the relevant HTML tags for the layout including `main`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `nav`, and so forth. I basically divided the page into three sections: `nav`, `hero-section` (and `stats`), `content`, and `footer`. Next, I laid out the most relevant HTML tags and content. I began by creating an unordered list with list elements for the navigation. I then added all of the landing page text content as a paragraph.</p>
              <p>The second step was creating the file directories. I created a folder for the project (`spacex-dragon`). In this folder I added the home/landing page (`index.html`) and an assets directory (`assets`). In assets I have created 4 folders: `css`, `img`, `js`, and `fonts`. Then I created the main CSS file (`main.css`).  With this completed, I had the file directory laid out. The next step was creating the basic HTML boolerplate code for the landing page. I then added meta tags for the description, author, icon (i.e., favicon), and added a link tag to connect my `main` css file.</p>
              <p>I knew how this content need to be laid out. For instance, I knew that `Dragon` was the title and `Sending Humans and Cargo` was the subtitle. I worked from h1 to h6 creating a machine-readable hierarchy. For the `Dragon Overview` I created an HTML table and added all the relevant details. I used HTML tags whenever possible to improve the machine-readability of the document. This is why, for instance, I only use a few `div` tags as these were generally unnecessary when there are more specific HTML tags that can be used (with a relevant class or ID as needed).</p>
              <p>For this project there was a vast amount of CSS involved. When I began working on the visual design of the website I first laid out my CSS. For instance, I used border-box sizing and smooth scrolling behaviour. I then used comments to section my CSS into `Responsive Images`, `Utility Classes`, `Color Theme`, `Fonts`, `Global Styles', `Default Selectors`, `Web Content`, `Customized for non-landing pages, `Adjustments for medium screens (tablets), and `Adjustments for small screens (phones)`. To set the color theme I used the root pseudoclass and created the relevant variables with names applied. I generally use <i>Color Hunt</i> when I am deciding on a color scheme.</p>
              <p>The process of writing all of the relevant CSS was time-consuming and iterative. This intuitive iterative process involved 1) planning visual changes, 2) thinking about relevant CSS tags, 3) writing the relevant code, and 4) reveiwing the changes. After doing this to complete the landing page I reviewd the overall aesthetic appearance and funtionality. I found issues with my color scheme and spacing of content that I had to resolve. On the landing page I have stats that count up. To do this I researched counters and found this could not be done by just utilizing CSS. My process of research was mutlifaceted involving both Google and GPT-4. For many questions I utilized GPT-4 instead of Google as  I found this process more efficient. As I mentioned my workflow process involved using GPT-4. In regard to coding I use GPT-4 for the following: syntax, documentation, and use cases of tags, resolving complex coding errors (it's faster & more efficient), researching SEO, and more.</p>
              <p>Now once I finished the landing page I duplicated it for the `History`, `FAQ`, and `Contact` pages. I had to first makes changes to navigation links, including replacing links pointing to that page with `#` and changing the landing page links from `#` to `index.html`. After this I tested every link on every page to ensure proper functionality. I followed the same general process of adding all content, structuring it with HTML tags, and then creating the desired visual appearance with CSS. In some cases I needed to make singular changes to a given class. For instance the `hero-section` needed to change background in the CSS for the other pages. The solution was adding IDs. For instance, the ID `hero-section-contact` was used on the contact page. These additions were put in the `Customized for non-landing pages` section of the CSS file.</p>
              <p>There are some other changes I haven't mentioned yet. These included 1) reducing file sizes through compression, 2) finding fonts, downloading and importing them, and then adding them, 3) deleting unnecessary images, 4) other optimizations, and 5) validating my HTML.</p>
              <p>Now that I finished the draft of my website I need to have others review my design. I asked my roommate (`Chris`) to review my website. He said that the letter-spacing for the numbers on the `stats` section was too large, that there was a lacking of spacing around the tect on the `Dragon Vehicle Overview` section, and there was duplicity of naming with `Dragon Vehicle`. He also mentioned that you could scroll to the right on the bottom for the "Follow SpaceX" section. I did not notice any of these issues originally. I wrote down the issues and then made the relevant changes. These changes were quite limited in scope, but were nevertheless important.</p>

              <h6 class="square-item">Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h6>
              <p>I read the article <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement/" target="_blank">Understanding Progressive Enhancement</a> from Northwestern. The article looked at the difference between <i>graceful degeneration</i> and <i>progress enhancement</i>. Essentially, graceful degeneration focuses on developing for the latest web browser and breaking the experience for old browsers as little as possible. By contrast, progressive enhancement focuses on making all web content acccessible and functional for new AND old browsers. Then the presentation and client-side scripting compose the outer layers.</p>
              <p>I read another great article that further explained Progressive Enhancement (PE). In the article <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/" target="_blank">"What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters"</a> some great points were made. PE emphasizes web content first, and then progressively adding more sophisticated and nuanced presentation and behavioral layers. Some major points are that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Basic <strong>content</strong> should be accessible to all web browsers</li>
                <li>Basic <strong>functionality</strong> should be accessible to all web browsers</li>
                <li>End-user web preferences are respected</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Here are the major stepss to follow:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Start with semantic HTML</li>
                <li>Add CSS for styling</li>
                <li>Use CSS media queries for responsive design</li>
                <li>Add JavaScript to enhance user experience</li>
                <li>Provide fallback content for non-supporting browsers</li>
              </ol>
