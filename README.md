# IFSC-1310
## Web Technologies
#### University of Arkansas at Little Rock

As as student in this course, I have completed a *variety* of projects spanning front-end development using programming languages including **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. I have also explored related technologies including:

1. File compression (especially for photos)
2. HTML/CSS/JS compression tools
3. Basic photo editing, and networking

My flagship project for the course is a website designed for the SpaceX Dragon. This was the final for the course, and I extended my design far beyond the relevant requirements as I am seeking to have *industry-readiness*.
