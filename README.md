# IFSC-1310
Web Technologies
University of Arkansas at Little Rock

As as student in this course, I have completed a variety of projects spanning front-end development using programming lanugages including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have also explored related technologies to a limited extent including file compression (especially for photos), HTML/CSS/JS compression tools, basic photo editing, and networking. My flagship project for the course is a website designed around SpaceX as a ficticious client. This was the final for the course, and I extended my design far beyond the relevant requirements as I seek to have industry-readiness.
